# boxsdk-python-folderdownload
An incomplete and lazy version of box sdk for folder download.

Feel free to modify and create a complete version of folder download.

Usage:
1. put the python file `DownloadBox.py` into the folder you want to save
2. create a box dev app with write permission (otherwise you wont be able to download the subfolders)
3. copy your "Developer Token"
4. install boxsdk from pip (`pip install boxsdk`)
5. run the python file
